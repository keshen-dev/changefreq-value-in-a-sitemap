# changefreq-value-in-a-sitemap

The "changefreq" value in a sitemap.xml file refers to the frequency at which the content on the corresponding URL is expected to change. There are five possible values for the "changefreq" attribute:

* always: This value indicates that the content on the URL changes very frequently and search engines should check for updates every time they access the URL.

* hourly: This value indicates that the content on the URL changes approximately every hour.

* daily: This value indicates that the content on the URL changes approximately every day.

* weekly: This value indicates that the content on the URL changes approximately every week.

* monthly: This value indicates that the content on the URL changes approximately every month.

It's important to note that the "changefreq" value is only a hint to search engines and they may not always follow it. It's also important to ensure that the value accurately reflects the frequency of changes on the URL to avoid misleading search engines.
